# spring-study
This repository contains the projects and exercises I've completed while studying Spring Boot, 
using the "스프링 부트를 활용한 애플리케이션 개발 실무" , 장정우, 2022" as a reference.
You can buy this book [here](https://wikibook.co.kr/springboot/).

## Tech Stack
The following technologies were used in the development of these projects:

- Open JDK 17
- Gradle
- Spring Boot 3.2.2
- PostgreSQL 14.10
- Redis

- **Spring Data JPA**: Object-relational mapping framework for database access.

- **OpenDSL**: Domain-specific language for defining data access logic.

- **JUnit**: Unit testing framework for Java.

- **RestTemplate**: Spring's web service client for consuming REST APIs.

- **Logback**: Logging framework for Java.

- **Actuator**: Spring Boot's framework for exposing application metrics and health information.

- **Spring Security**: JWT(JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization.

- **Swagger** (springdoc-openapi 2.3.0): OpenAPI specification generator for documenting REST APIs.

## Features:

* Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for products.

* REST API endpoints for managing product data.

* JPA-based data persistence using a relational database.

* OpenDSL for concise and expressive data access logic.

* Unit tests for thorough application validation.
  
* RestTemplate for consuming external APIs. (but actually not use external APIs)
  
* Logback for structured and flexible logging.
  
* Actuator for monitoring application health and performance.
  
* JWT-based authentication and authorization.
  
* Swagger documentation for comprehensive API exploration.
